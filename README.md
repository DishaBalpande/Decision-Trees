# Decision-Trees

Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for [classification](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-classification-vs-regression/) and [regression](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-classification-vs-regression/). The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target
variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
