# Decision-Trees

Decision Tree  are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. the goal is to create a model that predict the value of target variable by learning simple decison rules inferred from the data features.


Decision tree learn from data to approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules. The deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitte the model.
