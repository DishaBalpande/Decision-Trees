# Decision-Trees

Decision Tree  are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. the goal is to create a model that predict the value of target variable by learning simple decison rules inferred from the data features.


Decision tree learn from data to approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules. The deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitte the model.

## Classification 

DecisionTreeClassifier is a class capable of performing multi-class classification on a dataset.

 DecisionTreeClassifier takes as input two arrays: an array X, sparse or dense, of size [n_samples, n_features] holding the training samples, and an array Y of integer values, size [n_samples], holding the class labels for the training samples.
